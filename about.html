              <h2>Cuisine</h2>
              <p>
                All of our Steaks are hand cut U.S.D.A. Prime or Choice Grade Beef from top midwestern feeders. We age them four to six weeks in our in-house temperature controlled aging room to develop maximum flavor and tenderness. Then we grill them over our natural
                oak and citrus wood pit fire. You won't find a better steak. Our chefs have developed partnerships with local fisherman and companies that provided us with fresh dayboat caught seafood selections from our gulf waters and beyond. See our
                fishing fleet unloading daily on our docks.</p>
              <h2>Wines</h2>
              <p>
                Wine is a very integral component to the Go Fish Taphouse and Grill dining experience. We continually strive to maintain a diverse selection of both popular well-known wines as well as many that have very limited availability and particularly eclectic
                appeal. We are proud that our wine list has maintained its status as a Wine Spectator "award of excellence" list.
